LEGOâ„¢ Set "Builder" (set no 5610-1)
Category: Town (City, Construction)

Contains 20 pieces: 19 bricks, 1 minifigure

5610-1 Builder is a City impulse set released in 2008. It contains a construction worker
with a rolling cement mixer, along with 3 dark grey studs that resemble mortar or concrete.
When the mixer is pushed, the drum turns. The drum can also tilt side-to-side, but not
enough to dump the studs.
